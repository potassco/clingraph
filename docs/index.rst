Clingraph: A declarative graph visualizer
=========================================

A visualizer for graphs defined as a set of facts computed from logic programs. Graphs are generated using `graphviz <https://graphviz.org>`_ defined via fixed predicates from a list of facts.

It contains special features for integration with `clingo <https://potassco.org/clingo>`_!

.. note:: Clingraph is part the Potassco umbrella (which is the home of Clingo and the other ASP tools)
